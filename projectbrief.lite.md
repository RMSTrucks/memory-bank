# Memory Bank Project Brief

## Overview

The Memory Bank is a comprehensive system designed to equip Cline as an implementation partner who can translate ideas into code, manage projects effectively, and improve at these tasks over time despite memory resets between sessions. It serves as the core enabler for Cline to function as a technical co-pilot, turning high-level concepts into working implementations.

## Core Requirements

1. **Knowledge-Project Integration**
   - Project knowledge model connecting requirements, architecture, and implementation
   - Tools for capturing and formalizing project requirements
   - Mechanisms for tracking project decisions and their rationales
   - Capabilities for maintaining project context across sessions

2. **Code Generation Capabilities**
   - Pattern-based code generation tools
   - Templates for common implementation patterns
   - Validation mechanisms for generated code
   - Refactoring capabilities for iterative improvement

3. **Project Lifecycle Management**
   - Tools for managing project phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing)
   - Mechanisms for tracking project progress
   - Capabilities for identifying and mitigating project risks
   - Tools for documenting project outcomes and lessons learned

4. **Documentation System**
   - Structured hierarchy of documentation files
   - Cross-referencing and dependency tracking between documents
   - Automatic validation and consistency checks
   - Support for diagrams (Mermaid) and rich content

5. **Event System**
   - Project state change events
   - Implementation milestone events
   - Pattern detection and application events
   - Knowledge update events

   - Refine implementation patterns over time
   - Optimize project management processes
   - Enhance code generation capabilities

   - Helpful implementation guidance
   - Automated assistance for common tasks
   - Intuitive project management tools

4. **Knowledge Application**
   - Effective pattern detection and application to new projects
   - Clear tracking of project evolution
