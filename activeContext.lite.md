**Current Strategic Phase: Axe Sharpening**
Following Abraham Lincoln's wisdom that "if I had six hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first four sharpening the axe," we are currently in the axe sharpening phase. We're building capabilities, tools, and infrastructure to enhance my abilities as an implementation partner, enabling me to translate ideas into code, manage projects effectively, and improve at these tasks over time despite memory resets between sessions.

**Base Camp Objectives:**
1. **Knowledge-Project Integration**
   - Connect project requirements to implementation knowledge
   - Enable pattern-based implementation planning
   - Allow knowledge retrieval to guide implementation decisions
   - Create feedback loops for continuous project improvement

2. **Code Generation Capabilities**
   - Generate code based on implementation patterns
   - Apply templates for common implementation tasks
   - Validate generated code against requirements
   - Refactor and optimize implementations

3. **Project Lifecycle Management**
   - Track project progress from requirements to deployment
   - Manage implementation milestones and risks
   - Document project decisions and rationales
   - Ensure consistent implementation approach
