# Knowledge System Integration

## Overview

The Knowledge System MCP provides persistent memory capabilities for the Memory Bank project through vector embeddings stored in Pinecone. This integration allows us to store and retrieve information semantically, creating a true "memory" for our system.

## Current Status

âœ… **Integration Complete**: The Knowledge System MCP has been configured with a valid OpenAI API key and is ready for use. The API key has been updated in both the `.env` file and the MCP settings configuration.

After restarting VSCode, the Knowledge System MCP should be fully operational, allowing us to store and retrieve semantic memories.

## Configuration

The Knowledge System MCP has been configured with the following settings:

```json
"knowledge-system": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["C:/Users/jaked/OneDrive/Documents/Cline/MCP/knowledge-system/src/index.js"],
  "env": {
    "PINECONE_API_KEY": "pcsk_5BY5C_S3b3B7yP2cngaBvyZogcEGCZC8BME7kiThJden12M21S7eRS2QEzDc1TFaHMbve",
    "PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT": "us-west1-gcp",
    "PINECONE_INDEX_NAME": "cline-memory",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "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"
  },
  "disabled": false,
  "autoApprove": ["store_memory", "query_memories"]
}
```

## Available Tools

The Knowledge System MCP provides two main tools:

### 1. `store_memory`

Stores text and metadata as vector embeddings in Pinecone.

**Parameters:**
- `text` (required): The text content to store
- `metadata` (optional): Additional metadata to store with the memory

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  "text": "The Memory Bank project is a comprehensive knowledge management system with three phases.",
  "metadata": {
    "type": "project_summary",
    "date": "2025-02-25",
    "tags": ["memory-bank", "knowledge-system"]
  }
}
```

### 2. `query_memories`

Queries stored memories by semantic similarity.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (required): The query text to search for similar memories
- `limit` (optional): Maximum number of results to return (default: 5)

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  "query": "What is the current status of the Memory Bank project?",
  "limit": 3
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Storing Project Documentation

```javascript
// Store project documentation
use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "knowledge-system",
  tool_name: "store_memory",
  arguments: {
    text: "The Memory Bank project uses an event-driven architecture with a Neural Computation Framework.",
    metadata: {
      type: "architecture",
      component: "neural-computation-framework",
      date: "2025-02-25"
    }
  }
});
```

### Querying for Related Information

```javascript
// Query for information about the Neural Computation Framework
use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "knowledge-system",
  tool_name: "query_memories",
  arguments: {
    query: "How does the Neural Computation Framework work?",
    limit: 5
  }
});
```

## Integration with Memory Bank

The Knowledge System MCP serves as a critical component of our "Base Camp" milestone. It provides:

1. **Persistent Memory**: Information stored in the knowledge system persists across sessions
2. **Semantic Search**: The ability to find relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords
3. **Metadata Filtering**: Advanced filtering capabilities through metadata tags
4. **Vector Embeddings**: Efficient representation of knowledge in a high-dimensional space

## Activation Instructions

To activate the Knowledge System MCP:

1. Restart VSCode to apply the MCP settings changes
2. Verify the connection by storing a test memory
3. Query the system to ensure retrieval works correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Create Wrapper Functions**: Develop type-safe interfaces for knowledge operations
2. **Implement Error Handling**: Add robust error handling and retry mechanisms
3. **Develop Integration Tests**: Create comprehensive tests for the knowledge system
4. **Document API Patterns**: Create detailed documentation for common usage patterns

## Conclusion

The Knowledge System MCP integration marks a significant milestone in our project, establishing our "Base Camp" from which we can tackle more ambitious goals. With this integration, we now have a true memory system that can store and retrieve information semantically, providing a foundation for more advanced knowledge management capabilities.
