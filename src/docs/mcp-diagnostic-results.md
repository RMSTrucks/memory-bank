# MCP Diagnostic Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of the diagnostic tests performed to investigate MCP connection issues. The tests were conducted on February 26, 2025.

## Test Environment

- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Node.js Version**: v22.14.0
- **MCP Servers Tested**:
  - knowledge-system
  - file-operations-server

## Test Results

### 1. Direct Server Connection Test

We tested direct connections to the MCP servers using the `mcp-direct-access.js` utility:

- **Knowledge System Server**: ✅ Successfully connected
- **File Operations Server**: ✅ Successfully connected

The servers are able to start and respond to basic commands. The knowledge system server successfully lists available tools (`store_memory` and `query_memories`).

### 2. Tool Functionality Test

We tested the functionality of the available tools:

- **store_memory**: ❌ Error - "The argument to upsert had type errors: argument must be array."
- **query_memories**: ✅ Successfully executed (returned empty array)

The error with `store_memory` appears to be related to the format of data being sent to Pinecone. This suggests that the connection to the server itself is working, but there may be an issue with how the data is formatted for Pinecone.

### 3. Enhanced Server Logging

We implemented enhanced logging for the MCP servers to capture detailed information about the connection process. The logs show:

- Servers start successfully
- Environment variables are properly loaded
- Connections to external services (Pinecone, OpenAI) are established
- Communication between the client and server is functioning

### 4. Connection Monitor

We created a connection monitor script that captures all communication between the client and server. The monitor shows:

- Requests are properly formatted and sent to the server
- Responses are received from the server
- The connection is stable during the test period

## Identified Issues

1. **Data Format Issue**: The `store_memory` tool is failing because the data format expected by Pinecone has changed. The error message indicates that the argument to `upsert` must be an array, but the current implementation is not providing data in this format.

2. **VSCode Extension Connection**: While direct connections to the servers work, the VSCode extension may be using a different approach to connect to the servers. This could explain why the extension is having issues while direct connections work.

## Recommendations

1. **Update Pinecone Integration**: Modify the knowledge system server to format data as an array when sending to Pinecone's upsert method.

2. **Implement Direct Access Approach**: Consider implementing the direct access approach used in our diagnostic tools as an alternative to the current connection method in the VSCode extension.

3. **Enhanced Logging in Production**: Add more detailed logging to the production servers to help diagnose future issues.

4. **Connection Retry Logic**: Implement connection retry logic in the VSCode extension to handle temporary connection failures.

5. **Fallback Mechanism**: Develop a fallback mechanism that allows the system to continue functioning even if some MCP servers are unavailable.

## Next Steps

1. Update the knowledge system server to fix the Pinecone data format issue
2. Implement the recommended changes to the VSCode extension
3. Conduct further testing to ensure all issues are resolved
4. Update documentation to reflect the changes

## Conclusion

The diagnostic tests have identified specific issues with the MCP connection process. The core servers are functioning correctly, but there are issues with data formatting and potentially with how the VSCode extension connects to the servers. By addressing these issues, we should be able to resolve the current connection problems.
