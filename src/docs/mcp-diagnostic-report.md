# MCP Diagnostic Report

## Summary

We've conducted a comprehensive diagnostic of the Knowledge System MCP integration to identify the root cause of the connection issues. This report summarizes our findings and provides recommendations for resolving the issues.

## Diagnostic Results

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Environment Variables | ✅ PASS | All required variables are present and correctly formatted |
| Server Startup | ✅ PASS | Server starts successfully and connects to all services |
| Direct Communication | ✅ PASS | Successfully communicates with server |
| MCP Configuration | ✅ PASS | MCP configuration in VSCode is valid |

## Key Findings

1. **Environment Variables**: The environment variables are correctly configured, including:
   - PINECONE_API_KEY
   - PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT
   - PINECONE_INDEX_NAME
   - OPENAI_API_KEY (Project API key format: sk-proj-...)

2. **Server Startup**: The server starts successfully and connects to all services:
   - Process creation works correctly
   - Environment variables are loaded properly
   - Successful connection to OpenAI and Pinecone services
   - Server reports "Successfully connected to all services" in the logs

3. **Direct Communication**: The server responds correctly to requests:
   - Successfully lists available tools
   - Exposes "store_memory" and "query_memories" tools
   - Properly formats tool schemas and descriptions

4. **MCP Configuration**: The MCP configuration in VSCode is valid, with:
   - Correct command and arguments
   - Server not disabled
   - Proper environment variables
   - Appropriate autoApprove settings for tools

## Analysis

The diagnostic results confirm that all components of the Knowledge System MCP integration are working correctly:

1. **Server Functionality**: The server itself is working correctly and connecting to all required services (OpenAI and Pinecone).
2. **Communication**: Direct communication with the server works properly when tested outside of VSCode.
3. **Configuration**: The MCP configuration in VSCode is correctly set up.

The issue appears to be with the VSCode extension's ability to connect to the MCP server, not with the server itself or its configuration.

## Recommendations

Based on our comprehensive diagnostic, we recommend the following actions:

1. **VSCode Restart and Extension Refresh**:
   - Close VSCode completely (not just the window)
   - Restart VSCode to reload the MCP extension
   - This is the most likely solution as all components are working correctly

2. **Check VSCode Extension Logs**:
   - Look for any errors in the VSCode extension logs at: `%APPDATA%\Code\logs\`
   - Focus on MCP-related errors or connection issues

3. **Verify VSCode Extension Version**:
   - Ensure you're using the latest version of the Claude extension
   - Check for any known issues with MCP connections in the extension

4. **System Restart**:
   - If the issue persists after VSCode restart, try restarting your computer
   - This can resolve any system-level issues affecting the MCP connection

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Restart VSCode completely
   - Test the MCP connection again using the Claude extension
   - If issues persist, check the VSCode extension logs

2. **If Issues Persist After Restart**:
   - Run the diagnostic script again to verify all components are still working
   - Check for any changes in the environment or configuration
   - Consider reinstalling the Claude extension

3. **Alternative Usage Methods**:
   - Use the Knowledge System directly through the command line:
     ```
     cd C:/Users/jaked/OneDrive/Documents/Cline/MCP/knowledge-system
     node start-server.js
     ```
   - Then send requests directly to the server using stdin

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Document the diagnostic process and findings in the Memory Bank
   - Update the activeContext.md and progress.md files with the current status

## Conclusion

Our comprehensive diagnostic has confirmed that all components of the Knowledge System MCP integration are working correctly:

1. The environment variables are properly configured
2. The server starts successfully and connects to all required services
3. Direct communication with the server works properly
4. The MCP configuration in VSCode is valid

The issue appears to be limited to the VSCode extension's ability to connect to the MCP server, which is likely a temporary issue that can be resolved by restarting VSCode or your computer. This is a positive finding, as it means no code changes or configuration updates are needed.

The diagnostic tools we've created will be valuable for future troubleshooting and can be used to verify the system's functionality after any changes. By following the recommended actions, particularly restarting VSCode, we should be able to successfully integrate the Knowledge System with the Memory Bank project and enable the storage and retrieval of memories.
