# Memory Bank

An implementation partnership system with advanced cognitive tools and neural computation capabilities.

## Overview

Memory Bank is a sophisticated system designed to function as an implementation partner, capable of translating ideas into working code while maintaining perfect documentation and improving over time. It features a unique architecture that enables continuous learning and improvement despite memory resets between sessions.
